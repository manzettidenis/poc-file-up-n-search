Welcome to File Upload and Search System

This is a sample text file that demonstrates the capabilities of our file upload and search system. This proof-of-concept application allows you to:

1. Upload various file types including:
   - Text files (.txt)
   - PDF documents (.pdf)
   - Word documents (.doc, .docx)
   - Images (.jpg, .jpeg, .png)

2. Search through file contents using:
   - Full-text search functionality
   - Fuzzy matching algorithms
   - Real-time search as you type

3. Manage your files with features like:
   - File preview capabilities
   - Delete unwanted files
   - View file metadata and information

Key Technologies Used:
- Frontend: SolidJS with TypeScript and TailwindCSS
- Backend: Node.js with Express and TypeScript
- Search: Fuse.js for fuzzy search capabilities
- File Upload: Multer for handling multipart form data
- Architecture: Domain-Driven Design principles

Sample Search Terms:
Try searching for terms like "upload", "search", "SolidJS", "TypeScript", "Node.js", "DDD", or "architecture" to test the search functionality.

This system is designed as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate modern web development practices and effective file management solutions.
